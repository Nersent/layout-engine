# layout-engine
A simple layout engine written in C# (it will be ported to C++).

# Testing
To test it out if it works, simply create an index.html in Debug folder and style.css in Debug/CSS folder, and you can code.
For this moment only valid HTML works, so please don't test invalid HTML code. In CSS you can use only hex colors.
The `padding` rule doesn't work. You can use only `padding-left`, `padding-top`, `padding-right` and `padding-bottom`. The same as `margin`.
For borders you can use only this scheme:
`border: {width} solid {color}`.
